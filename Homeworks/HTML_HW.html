        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Have rack 1 rung up from center in oven.</li><br>
            <li>Gather your ingredients.</li><br>
            <li>Lightly flour work surface and roll out dough a bit; cut into 4 to 6 portions (I cut rectangles to keep
                it easy and based on how many people I'm feeding). Cut a small hole in center of each piece of dough
                with a 1-inch round or heart shaped cookie cutter, or freehand cut some slits or designs with tip of
                sharp small knife. Using a fork, beat an egg in a small dish with a splash of water. Line a baking sheet
                with a sheet of parchment and arrange dough pieces. Brush dough with egg wash and bake until puffed and
                golden, 20 to 22 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Peel and chop the onion and potato. Halve the celery and carrot lengthwise and chop. Halve the leek,
                trim top tough greens and roots and run under cold water while fanning the leek to release grit.
                Shake the leek of excess water and thinly slice. Peel and slice planks off the apple around the core,
                then stack and dice 1/4 inch.</li><br>
            <li>Heat a Dutch oven or large deep skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Melt butter and when it foams
                add the onion, potato, celery, leek, apple, bay and herb bundle and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.
                Cook to soften, 8 to 10 minutes, partially covered and stirring occasionally. Add flour and stir a minute.
                Add stock and whisk in to thicken a bit.</li><br>
            <li>Separate the chicken from the bones and skin and pull meat. Add to sauce to reheat. Remove bay and herbs.
                Remove chicken from heat and stir in Dijon mustard, cream and lemon juice.</li><br>
            <li>Serve the chicken and vegetables in bowls and top with pastry.</li><br>
